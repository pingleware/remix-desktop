# Remix Webapp
I like the web version of remix at https://remix.ethereum.org, but I found that after awhile, my browser become non-responsive, thus closing and loosing valuable work. A failed attempt to use the Remix desktop version and rebuild, lead me to develop this webapp. In essence, I put https://remix.ethereum.org in it's own web space and not shared in a generic browser like edge, chrome, firefox, etc. The result is fast automatic compile times, and no browser hang!

# Forked and Archived Desktop
I forked the desktop version and moved to a sub-directory named archived.

# Remix in HTTPS-mode
If you are using Web2 to connect a wallet to Remix, you will need to switch to http: mode. You can do this in the settings.json by specifying https: as "off"

# REMIX Desktop Version
You should try installing the official desktop version from the Remix Team at https://github.com/ethereum/remix-desktop. If the application will no launch, then download this webapp version.
